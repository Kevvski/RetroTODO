# RetroTODO
My first application when I started learning C++. It's a really simple application but does its job. Data is stored in .txt files and we can add, remove, set on done and undone each task. Done tasks are green and red tasks are undone. If you would like to come back to menu or close application, then app automatically save all changes to file.
